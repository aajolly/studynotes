## Discovery Questions
The following discovery questions are based on the **AI Discovery Model** used during a Business Value Discovery. A **Business Value Discovery** is an engagement that takes place with Business Buyers/Data Consumers after a Use Case has been validated. 

The AI Discovery Model is used to focus on the business use of data — and its impact on the business — as it relates to the Use Case being pursued. It's called the "AI" Discovery Model because the questions should be aligned with how the customer will Aggregate, Analyze, and Activate the data and then anchor back to the Impact it will have on the business.

| **ASK** | **WHY** |
| ------- | ------- |
| What are the primary objectives you want to achieve with a new data platform? | Knowing the business problems they’re trying to solve with a new or replacement data platform up front enables you to keep these main goals in mind so you can ensure that you address them. |
| How do you currently manage your data? What are some of the challenges you encounter? | Learn about their existing data platform to understand their challenges and limitations. |
| What type of workloads are you running? Are there any additional workloads you would like to run? | Learn the breadth of what they need from their data platform, currently and in the near future. For prospects running multiple workloads now or in the near future, there’s great value in having a single platform that can run all their workloads.|

| What are your data sources? How challenging is it to bring all your data together for cross-functional insights? | Knowing the data sources and how many data silos they have helps you understand the complexity of their data landscape.
| How do you currently maintain your data platform? What resources are involved, and what are the costs associated with it? | Having insight into the complexity and TCO of their current platform will help you (and them) determine/realize how much they can gain in terms of simplicity and cost savings with Snowflake’s fully managed platform. |
| What are your data security and governance requirements? What are the top challenges you face in meeting those requirements? | Snowflake’s universal governance is a key differentiator. Having the prospect voice their current requirements and challenges helps both of you determine/realize what can be gained with Snowflake’s universal governance. |
| How do you securely share data with partners, suppliers, and customers? Do you use any third-party data today? What are some of the challenges you encounter? | Even if they are not currently sharing data, this question provides an opportunity to discuss its growing importance and the business value it provides. |
| Do you currently support one or multiple clouds? What are your contingency plans in the event that your CSP has an outage? How concerned are you about cloud vendor lock-in?  | Knowing if a multi-cloud strategy would be helpful for them or even just getting them to think about it might be helpful later. Not everyone can provide a multi-cloud strategy. |
