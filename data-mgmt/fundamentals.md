> **Note:** Retention rules vary by data type and jurisdiction—understanding these is critical.

### Data Backups
Backups ensure data can be recovered in case of:
- System failure
- Natural disasters
- Cyberattacks

**Key concept: Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**
- Defines how much data loss is acceptable.
- Lower RPO = higher cost and complexity.

### Best Practices
- Plan early: Define archiving and backup strategies during system design.
- Balance cost vs. risk: Not all data needs zero-loss protection.
- Document ownership and policies: Know who owns the data and what rules apply.

## Data retetention and compliance
### What Is Data Retention?
Data retention refers to how long data is stored before it is archived or deleted. It’s a critical part of data governance and compliance.

### Why It Matters
- Regulatory Compliance: Laws like GDPR mandate specific retention periods for different data types.
    - Example: Employee records and performance reviews must be deleted 6 years after employment ends.
    - Financial and transactional data must be retained for at least 6 years.
- Operational Efficiency: Retaining unnecessary data increases storage costs and slows down systems.

### Best Practices
1. **Define Retention Periods Early**
    - Set policies during data collection and storage planning.
    - Avoid future confusion about who owns the data and how long it should be kept.
2. **Archive Strategically**
- Example: Keep 3 years of financial data in the OLTP database for reporting, and archive older data to cheaper storage.
3. **Document Everything**
- Track what data you have, where it’s stored, and its retention policy.
- Helps with audits and ensures compliance.
4. **Aggregate When Appropriate**
- For example, roll up detailed customer sales data after 3 years into summaries to reduce storage needs while preserving insights.

> **Note:** Retention policies should be a collaborative decision between data owners and compliance teams. They help balance legal obligations, business needs, and system performance.

## Data storage optimization
### Why Optimize Data Storage?
To reduce resource costs, improve efficiency, and maintain performance as data volumes grow.

### Key Optimization Techniques
1. **Tiered Storage**
- Hot Tier: Fast, expensive (e.g., flash storage) for frequently accessed data.
- Warm/Cold Tiers: Slower, cheaper for less-accessed data.
- Often managed automatically by SAN (Storage Area Network) systems.
2. **Cold Storage**
- Ideal for archived data that’s rarely accessed.
- Examples: Azure Blob Archive, AWS S3 Glacier.
3. **Deduplication**
- Stores identical data blocks only once.
- Greatly reduces storage footprint, especially in large datasets.
- May introduce performance overhead—test before enabling in production.
4. **Cloud Storage Optimization**
- Use lower-cost cloud tiers for backups or non-critical data.
- Example: Move old SQL Server backups to blob storage to save money and reduce active database load.

> **Note:** Storage optimization is about balancing cost, performance, and accessibility. Techniques like tiering, deduplication, and cloud archiving help manage growing data volumes efficiently.
