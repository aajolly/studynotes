# First Impressions
## Psychological Process of first impressions
It takes 7 seconds to form a first impression and here's how those 7 seconds look like:
1. You look at that person's clothing.
2. You look at that person's body language.
3. You make assumptions about that person's life.
4. You create a first impression filter.

So how to tackle your first impression.
Choose the clothing color wisely, if you want to look confident and powerful wear navy blue or charcoal/black outfit.
Match your body language with your outfit
- Have a good posture. 
- Maintain eye contact
- Firm handshake
- Smile
- Take more space
- Talk slowly

# Projecting Confidence
Sometimes when I meet people, I get intimidated by them. How can I make that person feel I'm confident when I'm actually not?

This often happens when we meet people for the first time, or when we're in a new situation.

Focus on body language, our body language is congruent with how you are feeling at that time. To project confidence, you need to use confident body language. This will convince others you can take on the world.

# Dealing with difficult people
At work, I sometimes have to deal with people with all kinds of attitudes. What is the best way to deal with these people?
