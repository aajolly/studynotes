# Overview
We all know the importance of conversations, but what is it exactly?
- Conversations are an exchange between 2 or more people with a sense of immediacy on a topic that is pre-existing or new.
- Conversations can be difficult when no content or topics of conversation have been provided.
- Conversations are how you express your worth in business.

# Roles inside a conversation
1. **Conversation Leader**: This is the person that guides the conversation. Asks questions and actively listens.
2. **Conversation Follower**: A person who answers the questions and does most of talking.

Strive to be a conversation leader and let the other person talk more, show genuine interest and they will love you for it.

# Stages of a Conversation
Use the below framework to start a conversation

## Stage1: Introduction and Small Talk
This stage is about introductions and the aim is to establish familiarity for the know factor. This also helps in finding similarities to build the like factoryand you have two options:
1. Introduction + question/statement method
So what topics can you talk about, if meeting physically, talk about your surrondings, for example:
**Intro + Question method**:
a) Hi, I'm Aashish, what's your name?
b) Hi, I'm Aashish, are you enjoying the event?
c) Hi, I'm Aashish, what company are you from?

**Intro + Statement method**
a) Hi, my name's Aashish. I heard you're the Chief Marination Officer at Versent.
b) Hi, I'm Aashish. Isn't this event crowded!
c) Hi, I'm Aashish. I love the bag you're carrying.

Often the reason we like somebody is because we think they like us.
Not all compliments are valid in a business setting. Keep the compliments professional focused. Here's what you can compliment on:
a) You can compliment on a object that person is wearing or carrying like a bag, headset or a back-pack. Ask questions like where did you get it from? how long have you had it for?
b) You can compliment on an accomplishment that person has made. For example, a promotion they had or an award they won.

2. Question/statement method
Not all situations will welcome a formal introduction. Talking about your surrondings is a great way to get somebody talking in a casual and non-threatening manner. For example, say there's a meeting and before the meeting there are a few people standing outside, you could say you look bright and ready for the meeting, do you know how many people are attending?

## Stage2: Intelligent Exchange
Stage2 topics could be difficult to think of on the spot. There are two things that can help you.
1. Know a little about a lot of things, so that you can switch to a deerper topic. Watching news, movies, reading blog posts is a great way to know more about a lot of things.
2. Train yourself to express that knowledge in an articulate and structured way. Here are typical conversation structures:
- Telling a story with a beginning, middle and end.
- **Zooming In**: Start with a broad story view and narrow down your focus to get closer to a specific point in your story.
- **Zooming Out**: Start with something very specific, move toward drawing parallels with other similar elements and conclude with a general idea.
- **Debate style**: Argue the pros and cons and come up with a balanced conclusion.

Talk about a company, industry, or related industry topic.
Examples of the story pattern:
1. So XXXX, what prompted you to become a qualified accountant?
2. How many years did it take you to become an accountant?
3. Did you encounter any difficulties completing your qualifications?
4. How did you find your first job?

Some more examples:
1. When was your company founded?
2. What was the state of the industry at that time?
3. What did it take for the company to grow?
4. During that time, was it ever in a difficult place?
5. What is your company's outlook now? Where do you see growth?

Some examples of using the **debate** style.
1. How do you think mining impacts the environment?
2. Are the modern techniques of extraction evolving toward an eco-friendly model?
3. Would implementing an eco-friendly system be cost-prohibitive and counter-productive for the mining industry?
4. How necessary is mining with respect to the colossal development that developing countries are undergoing?

Some examples of using the **zooming-in technique**
Based on the topic of discussion in Stage1, you could pick on it and zoom into it. For example stage1 topic was about healthy eating. Below could be some questions to continue the discussion.
1. I keep reading about healthy eating related to businesses starting up. Have you seen any news about this recently?
2. I hear there are a number of ways technology can support the development of such businesses. What do you think about that given your experience in the IT industry?
3. One start-up that really caught my attention has developed an app that learns about your shopping habits and suggests ways you can improve your diet. How do you think this particular start-up would do?
4. The CEO and founder of this start-up is apparently an alumnus of your company. Do you know her?

Some examples of using the **zooming-out technique**
1. I'd like to get an idea about the work habits of mining executives. Can you describe to me what a typical day in the office is like for you?
2. How about the people around you. How long do they work?
3. What is the role of overwork in mining accidents? How does overwork impact mining accidents?
4. I read recently the World Labour Organisation is trying to create more work/like balance. They're trying to see how people can organise their time and productivity. Do you see any ways in which you could work less but be just as productive?

When you add topics to a conversation, you're perceived as interesting and engaging.

## Stage3: Bonding
In Stage3 of conversations, people decide whether they want to stay in touch.
Here are some phrases that are commonly used at the bonding stage.
- Tell me why...
- What do you think about...?
- What's your opinion on...?

With these phrases, you're trying to understand the other person's attitude, ideas and opinions.
