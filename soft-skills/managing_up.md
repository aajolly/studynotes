# Managing Up - LinkedIn Learning

**Q.** **Why is managing up important?**

**A.** From personal experience, it is important to manage up as it impacts your professional life:

- The projects you get
- Visibility within the organization
- Career growth

**Myth**: Managing up means sucking up

Your strength should be to align and work with any type of boss. The only person/human we can change in this world is ourselves, expecting other people to align themselves with your style will only add to stress. Being flexible and ready to align with anyone will help you succeed faster.
